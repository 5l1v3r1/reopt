radss_compare <FILENAME1> --addr1 <FUNCTIONADDR1> <FILENAME2> --addr2
<FUNCTIONADDR2> --rip <RIPMAPFILE> --gpr <GPRMAPFILE>

produces a file in /tmp/ for each entry in <RIPMAPFILE> that is an SMT formula
satisfiable if there is an assignment of initial register values obeying
<GPRMAPFILE> such that the final values do not obey <GPRMAPFILE>

This doesn't necessarily mean the programs are not equivalent in principle - the
mapping of registers is not always consistent throughout a function, especially
near the beginning and end.

Known working cases as of 8/21/2015:
xorshift.1234 and xorshift.123456, /tmp/sat_trans_401036 and
/tmp/sat_trans_40101b

fib_test.1234 and fib_test.123456, /tmp/sat_trans_401054
